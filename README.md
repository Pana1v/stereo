## Usage

### Basic Depth Estimation
Run the basic depth estimation methods:

```bash
python run_depth_estimation.py
```

This will process the test images and generate `depth_estimation_results.png` with comparisons of gradient, Laplacian, and blur-based methods.

### Advanced Depth Estimation
Run the advanced depth estimation including MiDaS:

```bash
python advanced_depth_estimation.py
```

This will generate `advanced_depth_estimation_results.png` with comprehensive comparisons including the MiDaS deep learning model.

### Comprehensive Model Comparison
Compare multiple state-of-the-art depth estimation models:

```bash
python comprehensive_depth_comparison.py
```

This will generate `comprehensive_depth_comparison_download.png` with a 2x3 grid showing:
- Original image
- DPT-Large depth map
- DPT-BEiT-Large depth map  
- MiDaS-Large depth map
- MiDaS-Small depth map

### Advanced Models Comparison
Compare the best alternatives to MiDaS:

```bash
python advanced_depth_models_comparison_fixed.py
```

### Jupyter Notebook
For interactive experimentation:

```bash
jupyter notebook stereo_depth_estimation.ipynb
```
